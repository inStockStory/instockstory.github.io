## Introduction
When you want to download an App on your iphone, most of you may look through some reviews, especially that App is paid. Do you prefer to look 5 star reviews or 1 star reviews? Which one is helpful for you? After you get clear about all of its strength and drawbacks. You decide to pay $4.99 and download it. You feel it is good, but when your friend who use Samsung tells you he download it by free, you become angry soon. How could this happen? They are a same app ! My friend use Android mobile phone, he prefer same apps as me, but for all Ios and Android customers, Are their preference the same? Where are those developers living? If they address is close to me, I need to knock their door and tell them to update soon because this app cannot fill my new iphone XS plus’s screen...... People use mobile phone so frequently, and this lead to many interesting questions. In this project, we focus on finding the answer of those interesting questions to you.

## Data Munging

### Data Source  
We first download apple dataset from a kaggles dataset:

(like https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).

And we download the Google Play dataset:

(like https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)

After the data munging and cleaning, the dataset has the features, such as app name, size, price, rating, etc.

### Apple Data Scrapping
We are also intrested in what people would say in their App reviews. From the user reviews, developers can evaluate their App and understand what they should keep, avoid and make change or improvement.
Since for each App, Apple only release top 50 reviews by review categories, we scrapped 50 most helpful reviews which defined by iTunes. Note that some App does not have any review.

Our scrapping data has the features of individual rating, title content and review content.

## User Preference
### Rating
- The original datasets rounded the rating as gap of 0.5. However, we can still see that the majority of the rating in the range of 3.5 to 4.5 in the Apple Store. Also, the number of extreme rating (1, 5) is relatively small/ Also, our Apple dataset contains some unpopular or new Apps, so the rating is shown as 0. The graph shows that our datasets contais about 1000 of such Apps.

- The rating data of Google play stores is more specific. In the dataset of Google Play, most APPs are high rating which are concentrated between 4.1 and 4.6, and thier most frequent rating is also around 4.5. The number of extreme rating is relatively small as well.

### Category   
- Apple Store

As the pie chart shown, catrgory of Games are more than half of the dataset. After research, this might because Apple's API have more open data with Games category. The major categories are "Games", "Entertainment" and "Educaton". For the inner circle, the number of free app is only slightly larger than the number of paid app.

1. Excluded App with no rating, the rating are quite similiar in different categories. While the differences are very small, Book category has the highest average rating and Sports category has the lowest average rating.
2. The bar plot of average rating count shows that Apple users are more likely to comment on Social Networking category. This might because the social networking applications in our dataset are usually very popular, e.g. Facebook, which explains why does this category has the most average comment.
3. (and 4) The bar plot of average APP size and average price show that Medical has the highest average size and price while the Games category is second higherst average size. We have looked at it above: Most of the big size and expensive Medical Apps are 3D anatomy structcture Applications.

- Google Play

The category in Google Play store is more diversed. The major categories are "Game", "Family" and "Tools". For the inner circle, the number of free app is much larger than the number of paid app. From the above pie charts, we can see that the major of the category in both markets is game. However, the two markets show huge difference in the proportion of free app. We did further exploration based on such inconsistency.

1. From the bar plot of average rating, we can see that the rating are high and very similiar in different categories. While the differences are very small, Events category has the highest average rating and Dating category has the lowest average rating.
2. Similiar with Apple market, Communication and social category have the most average review. After briefly looking at the data, we get the same explaination as Apple market which is those App are much popular than others.
3. The bar plot of average App size shows that the Games category has the biggest average App size. Furthermore, the overall size distribution in Google Play store is smaller than Apple store. The reason is that phones with android systerm are varies. The APP size in the Android market is only like a zip file with maximum 100 megabytes , while the real size is larger than what it was shown in the Google play store page.
4. The bar plot of average price show that the most expensive categories are finance,events lifestyle. After looking at the dataset, the categories of Finance and Lifestyle contains many joking Apps like 'I am rich', while category of Events only has one paid App which is $109. Beside these three categories, the overall prices are more normal.

From the Boxplot of Apple store, we can see that medical has the most spreaded distribution. We looked into top 4 most expensive applications in the medical category, and we find that those Apps are designed as 3D model for Anatomy, and most of them have relatively large size. Beside the one only has 125 megabyte, which only recive 1 person to rate and the low rating.

- Google Play: interquartile of price is [1.99, 4.99]

From the boxplot of Google play store, we can see that the category of Finance has an extremly long box. We again looked into the top 4 most expensive application in Finance. The result shows that all of them are joking Apps, 'I am rich'. Those App has only small sizes and low versions but super expensive prices. From this analysis, we can see that Apple store might have more strick policy for App development approval or policy for price setting than Google play store.

## User Review
- Word Cloud For the 1 Star Reviews in Apple Store

From this 1 star wordcloud, we can see that after we filter out words like "Terrible", "Horrible","Bad"..... We can find some major complains such as "not interesting", "Waste of time and money","Many ads", "Bugs, Crashes, Rip off, Scam", "No sound".

- Word Cloud For the 5 Star Reviews in Apple Store

For this 5 star word cloud, although we have already filtered out some positive words, there are still a lot of similar praises in this wordcloud. It didn't give us too much useful infromation.

- Word Length
Combining the boxplot and the median comparison of those 5 rating groups.We can find that for those people who give 5 stars, they tend to type less words. We think this is because they are very satisfied and don’t have too much suggestions to give. For people who give less stars, they say relatively more contents. This means those people tend to give more suggestions in their review.

## Market Comparison
### Difference in Price
For those App in IOS paid but Android free, there are 132. For those App in Android paid but IOS free, there are 5. We studied why this difference happened, and found that in those 132 Apps, 96 have In-App-Purchase in Android market.

From this sankey diagram, we can find that there is a huge difference in number when one is free but another is paid. For those in Android free but iOS paid, there are 132 observations, but for those in iOS free but Android paid, there are only 5. we continue to study and find that for those 132 observations, ¾ of them have In-App-Purchase. We guess that maybe in android market. App developers are more willing to set free download of their app at first in Android market than in iOS market to attract customers, and use other methods like in-app-purchase to make profits.

### Difference in Rating
From this plot, The orange one reflects the IOS rating and the blue one reflects the Android rating.We can see that for those Apps released in both market, when they have different prices, most of their android prices tend to concentrate on the interval of 3.5 to 4.5, but for IOS market, their rating tend to be distributed more in all other intervals. We think this shows that customer in Android Market are more willing to give a relatively neutral or positve rating for an app, but in IOS market, those ratings tend to distributed more in other ranges.
